                                                    You'll need to make sure your pigs exercise regularly to avoid obesity and constipation and to stop their feet from becoming overgrown. They'll also need regular checks from a vet to make sure they're in good health.

                                                        Pigs need access to water at all times. They do not have the ability to perspire, so water is important to them. Some pigs drink a lot of water daily, some very little. Each pig is different regarding water intake. We use stainless steel non-tip bowls.

                                                        Yes, some little piggies really enjoy watching TV or videos (especially about pigs!) while they are camped out on your lap! They might even develop an enjoyment for certain TV shows. Some owners put music on or keep the TV on for those times when the owners are not home.
